## Subjects Table Enhancements — completed 2026-05-09

- **Category column:** Added Category column between Subject and Status in the subjects table; added `categoryLabel()` helper; added `.category-badge` global style; updated grid from 3 to 4 columns
- **Sort functionality:** Added `sorted` computed signal that applies sort order (priority, title, Q&A count, status) reactively to `store.filtered()`; sort buttons now reorder the table live
- **Inline status dropdown:** Clicking the status badge opens a small popover with all 5 status options; selecting one calls `store.updateSubject()` and closes the menu; backdrop dismisses on outside click; each status has a distinct colour (gray / blue / amber / teal / green)
- Added per-status CSS variables and `.badge` modifier classes (`status-not-started` through `status-mastered`) to `styles.scss`
- Projects affected: `job-mate`
- Playwright test added: no

## Subject Creation Navigation Fix — completed 2026-05-09

- After `store.addSubject()` resolves, navigate to `/subjects/:id` (new subject detail) instead of staying on `/subjects`
- Changed default category from `'javascript'` to `'angular'` in both `FormControl` definition and `openForm()` reset
- Projects affected: `job-mate`
- Playwright test added: no

## Subject Detail — Note View/Edit Mode — completed 2026-05-09

- Notes tab now defaults to read-only view: renders saved HTML via `[innerHTML]`, shows "Edit note" button
- Clicking "Edit note" enters edit mode: shows Tiptap rich editor + Cancel / Save Note buttons
- Cancel restores `noteHtml` from the store and returns to view mode
- Save Note persists the note (add or update) and navigates back to `/subjects`
- Note content displayed at 13.5 px matching editor size; read mode uses same border/bg container as the editor
- Projects affected: `job-mate`
- Playwright test added: no

## Code Syntax Highlighting with Theme Switcher — completed 2026-05-10

- Installed `highlight.js`; 6 theme CSS files copied to `public/hljs-themes/` as static assets
- `<link id="hljs-theme">` in `index.html` — swapped at runtime by `CodeThemeService`
- `CodeThemeService` persists selected theme in `localStorage`; sets `--hljs-bg`, `--hljs-text-color`, `--hljs-border` CSS custom properties on `:root`
- Note read mode: `processedNoteHtml` computed signal runs `DOMParser` + `hljs.highlight()` on the note HTML string before binding — no DOM side effects
- Settings page: "Code theme" card with colour swatches (background + 4 token colour dots per theme) and a live TypeScript code preview that updates instantly on theme selection
- Themes available: GitHub Dimmed (default), GitHub Dark, Atom One Dark, Tokyo Night, Monokai, Atom One Light
- Projects affected: `job-mate`
- Playwright test added: no
